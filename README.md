A C++ console program for the pre-requisite in the subject Data Structure and Algorithms

## Introduction
Welcome to the C++ console-based poker game. This game allows you to play against three computer opponents and test your poker skills. The game follows the rules of Texas Hold'em, and at the end of each match, the card hands are analyzed to determine the winner.

## Gameplay
1. Start the game by providing your username and password to access your account or create a new account if it doesn't exist.
2. Each player starts with a specified amount of money in their account, and the minimum bet is set.
3. During each betting round, you can choose to check, call, raise, or fold based on your current hand and betting strategy.
4. The computer opponents use basic poker strategies to make their decisions.
5. At the end of the match, the winner is detemrined based on the hand ranking, and the winner/s receives the pot.

## Moveset
1. Check - still in the game but will not bet.
2. Call - adds a money equivalent to the minimum bet to the pot
3. Fold - surrender
4. Raise - raises the minimum bet

## Features
1. Account Handling
     The program uses account handling wherein the user is asked to input their username and password to be saved in a .csv file. Initially, the users are given $100 but it will update depending on how much you gain or lost while playing.
2. Computer Mechanics
     The program's computer players are coded to pick their move depending on their money and the minimum bet.
3.  Gameplay
     The program is made to replicate the poker game as close as the programmers can

## Future of the Program
NOTE: this program is not yet perfected, and any modifications that will help the program reach that state is allowed
1. Improvement on the code
    The program aims to have a much more manageable, scalable, and readable coding structure
2. Added Features
     More features to be added especially on the accounts part
3. Rework of the Logic
     Despite the use of if-else to properly evaluate the different instances, a much more logical and systematic approach is expected
4. Multiplayer
      Make the program available to multiple devices at once
